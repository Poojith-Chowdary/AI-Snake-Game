# AI-Snake-Game
This project introduces an innovative approach to enhance the traditional Snake game by incorporating the A* algorithm for autonomous gameplay. The Snake game, a classic in the realm of video games, usually involves manual control by the player. In our implementation, we leverage the A* algorithm, a popular pathfinding and graph traversal technique, to enable the Snake to navigate the game environment autonomously. The A* algorithm is employed to find the optimal path for the Snake to follow in order to reach the target food item. The game environment is represented as a grid, where each cell is a potential node in the graph. The A* algorithm efficiently explores this grid, considering both the distance to the goal and obstacles present, to determine the best route for the Snake. To ensure a challenging and dynamic gaming experience, the Snake's autonomous decision-making is coupled with an adaptive difficulty system. As the Snake successfully consumes food, the algorithm adapts to create more complex and intricate paths, requiring the Snake to exhibit increasingly sophisticated navigation skills. 
The implementation also includes a user interface that provides real-time visualization of the Snake's decision-making process, allowing players to observe and understand the algorithmic choices behind the autonomous gameplay. Additionally, the game features multiple difficulty levels, allowing players to choose the level of challenge that suits their preferences. This project aims to showcase the capabilities of the A* algorithm in the context of a well-known and loved game, demonstrating how artificial intelligence techniques can be seamlessly integrated into entertainment applications to enhance user experience and engagement.
